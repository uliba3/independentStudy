        "abstract": "My passion for music and Chinese finally began to overlap when I studied abroad in Beijing in the fall of 2010. Since then, this passion has only continued growing, becoming a more and more important part of my life. This project is an exploration of the sub-culture of underground rock, punk and experimental music in Beijing and my experience within it. It was my intention to create a document that is fully accessible in both English and Chinese. Or at least accessible in Chinese to the fullest of my linguistic capacity. I chose to use a collection of mediums because I believe it is the best way to present the most detailed portrait of the Beijing underground scene.",

        "authors": "Adam Stephan Jankowski, The College of WoosterFollow",
        "abstract": "Chinese foreign policy is an extremely dynamic factor in today's world. One way of trying to describe Chinese foreign policy is by determining national role conceptions of Chinese leaders. The national role conception that Chinese leaders have plays an essential part in the development and implementation of Chinese foreign policy. The different conceptions of China's role in the international system, as determined by Chinese leaders, gives an important contribution to understanding the rise of China as a leading world power. It is obvious that different leaders have had different views regarding what China's position should be in the global community. Some leaders have wanted China to become a world leader while others have wanted China to play a different part in international affairs by being a spectator. These different foreign policy behaviors can potentially be a result of the way in which Chinese leaders view themselves in the international system. Therefore, I hypothesize that Chinese national role conception, as determined by Chinese political leaders, leads to the foreign policy behavior of China. With this hypothesis, I wish to document the changes in Chinese leaders' national role conceptions and see if those differing views have led to different foreign policy behavior. This will occur through an analysis of speeches, documents, and writings of different Chinese leaders including Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao. The sources will be analyzed to develop national role conceptions and see if the differing conceptions resulted in different foreign policy behavior.",

        "authors": "Xiaochen Zhang, The College of Wooster",
        "abstract": "In the context of a popular topic, China's investment in Africa, this paper delves into China's resource focused investment and the impact that this investment has on African wage inequality. The theoretical model expands on the classic 2x2 Heckshcher-Ohlin Stopler Samuelson model, and a more recent theoretical ideology known as the \"Dutch Disease\" model, to show how changes in the relative supply and relative price of African resource goods can affect African wage inequality. A discourse analysis comparing and contrasting the conflicting perspectives of the Chinese media, Western media, and African media revealed three different ideological stances on the issue of Sino-African relations. OLS regression models were conducted, and although results showed that Chinese FDI and corruption had a correlation with greater African inequality. However, due to data availability and estimation issues, the results should be taken with caution and under suspicion. Review of media sources, journal articles, books, and documentaries revealed that African countries must be cautious of China's FDI, and China's goal of extracting African natural resources. Thus, African governments and its leaders must devise proper policies towards Chinese FDI, in order to protect themselves from resource exploitation.",
